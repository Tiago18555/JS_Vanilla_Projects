1
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,030
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

3
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,120
'Cause of something that happened before I was even born.

4
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,380
See, a long time ago, there was this family.

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,460
The Papa, he was a musician.

6
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,990
He and his family would sing and dance

7
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,400
and count their blessings.

8
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,730
But he also had a dream.

9
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
To play for the world.

10
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,150
And one day...

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
he left with his guitar...

12
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,650
and never returned.

13
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,580
And my Mama...

14
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,870
She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician.

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,050
After banishing all music from her life...

16
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,360
she found a way to provide for her daughter.

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,180
She rolled up her sleeves...

18
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,220
and she learned to make shoes.

19
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,820
She could have made candy.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,670
O-o-or fireworks.

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,560
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,180
But no.

23
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,730
She chose shoes.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,430
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,330
And later, she taught her son-in-law.

26
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,700
Then her grandkids got roped in.

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,990
As her family grew, so did the business.

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,150
Music have torn her family apart.

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,380
But shoes held them all together.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,970
You see that woman...

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,540
was my great-great-grandmother...

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,720
Mama Imelda.

33
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,100
She died way before I was born.

34
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,670
But my family still tells her story...

35
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,630
every year on Dia de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead...

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,780
And her little girl? She's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco.

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,130
Hola, Mama Coco.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,280
How are you, Julio?

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,470
Actually, my name is Miguel.

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,190
Mama Coco has trouble remembering things.

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,340
But it's good to talk to her, anyway.

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,360
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,020
I used to run like this.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,670
But now I run like this, it's just way faster.

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,750
The winner is... luchadora Coco!

46
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,530
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side.

47
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,790
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

48
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,620
Miguel, eat your food.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,020
My abuelita, she's Mama Coco's daughter.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,130
Aw, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.

51
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,240
No, gracias.

52
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,820
I asked if you would like more tamales.

53
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,480
S-Si?

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,670
That's what I thought you said!

55
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,890
Abuelita runs the house just as Mama Imelda did.

56
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,380
No music!

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,290
No music!

58
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,290
No music!

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,910
I think we're the only family in Mexico who hates music.

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,960
And my family's fine with that.

61
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,920
But me...

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,220
Be back by lunch, mijo.

63
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,220
Be back by lunch, mijo.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,420
Love you, Mama!

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,900
I'm not like the rest of my family.

66
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,970
- Hola, Miguel. - Hola.

67
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,890
- Muchas gracias! - De nada, Miguel!

68
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,640
He-hey, Dante!

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Sit.

70
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,160
Down.

71
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,280
Roll over.

72
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,280
Shake.

73
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,840
Fist bump.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,210
Good boy, Dante!

75
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,750
I know, I'm not supposed to love music.

76
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,750
But it's not my fault.

77
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,430
It's his.

78
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,510
Ernesto de la Cruz.

79
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,400
The greatest musician of all time.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,360
Here in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,780
took his first steps toward becoming

82
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,020
the most beloved singer in Mexican history.

83
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,420
He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,950
But when he played music,

85
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,600
he made people fall in love with him.

86
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,130
He starred in movies.

87
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,620
He had the coolest guitar.

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,390
He could fly!

89
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,250
And he wrote the best songs.

90
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,380
But my all-time favorite is...

91
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,800
He lived the kind of life you dream about...

92
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,870
Until 1942.

93
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,120
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

94
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,140
I wanna be just like him.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,380
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
and I get this feeling.

97
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,590
Like we're connected somehow.

98
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,630
Like if he could play music...

99
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,460
maybe someday, I could too!

100
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,740
If it wasn't for my family.

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,650
Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!

102
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,630
Huh?

103
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,640
I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story.

104
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,190
Oh, yeah, sorry.

105
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,550
I just can't really talk about any of this at home, so.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,060
Look, if I were you,

107
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,060
I'd march right up to my family and say,

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,540
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it!"

109
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,140
I could never say that.

110
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,480
I-I-I don't know.

111
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,970
I mean, I only really play for myself.

112
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,170
Ah! Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician

113
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,370
by hiding his sweet, sweet skills?

114
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,420
No!

115
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,510
He walked out onto that plaza

116
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,650
and he played out loud!

117
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,920
Mira, Mira, they're setting up for tonight.

118
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,620
The music competition for Dia de Muertos.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,480
You wanna be like your hero? You should sign up!

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Unh-unh. My family would freak!

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,070
Look, if you're too scared, then, well, have fun making shoes.

122
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,150
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,390
Seize your moment?

124
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,280
Show me what you got, muchacho.

125
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll be your first audience.

126
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,850
Miguel!

127
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,720
Ah!

128
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,660
Abuelita!

129
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,260
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,070
Um... oh... uh...

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,840
You leave my grandson alone!

132
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,600
Do?a, please! I was just getting a shine.

133
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,190
I know your tricks, mariachi.

134
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,360
What did he say to you?

135
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,030
He was just showing me his guitar.

136
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,640
Shame on you!

137
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,330
My grandson is a is a sweet little

138
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,770
angelito, perrito, cielito!

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,420
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.

140
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,080
You keep away from him.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,950
Ay, pobrecito!

142
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,190
Estas bien, mijo.

143
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,090
You know better than to be here in this place.

144
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,980
You will come home. Now.

145
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,900
How many times have we told you?

146
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,160
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

147
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,950
Yes, Tio Berto.

148
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,380
No, no, no, no, no.

149
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,560
Hey, go away, you. Go!

150
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,050
It's just Dante.

151
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,910
Never name a street dog.

152
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,320
They'll follow you forever.

153
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,190
Now, go get my shoe.

154
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,980
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,410
Ay, Miguel?

156
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,670
You know how abuelita feels about the plaza.

157
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,960
I was just shining shoes.

158
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,530
A musician's shoes.

159
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,780
But the plaza's where the foot traffic is.

160
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,570
If abuelita says, "No more plaza", then no more plaza.

161
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,860
But what about tonight?

162
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,870
What's tonight?

163
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,780
Well, they're having this talent show.

164
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,810
- A-and I thought I might... - Sign up?

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,950
Well, maybe?

166
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,770
You have to have talent to be in a talent show.

167
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,700
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes? Oh!

168
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,900
It's Dia de los Muertos. No one's going any where.

169
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,750
Tonight is about family.

170
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,470
Ofrenda room. Vamonos.

171
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,080
Don't give me that look.

172
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,680
Dia de los Muertos is the one night of the year

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,970
our ancestors can come visit us.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,950
We put their photos on the ofrenda

175
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,040
so their spririts can cross over.

176
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,010
That is very important.

177
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,750
If we don't put them up, they can't come.

178
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,230
We made all this food.

179
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,360
Set out the things they loved in life, mijo.

180
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,750
All this work to bring the family together.

181
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,360
I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where.

182
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,500
Huh! Where are you going?

183
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,080
- I thought we were done. - Ay, Dios mio.

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,660
Being part of this family means being here for this family.

185
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,280
I don't want to see you end up like...

186
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,730
Like Mama Coco's papa?

187
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,430
Never mention that man!

188
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,600
He's better off forgotten.

189
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,940
- But you're the one who... - Eh, thchhsss!

190
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,380
- I was just... - Tchsshh!

191
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,100
- But... - Tchshh.

192
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,870
- I... - Shhh.

193
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,090
Papa?

194
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,820
Papa is home?

195
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,270
Mama, calmese, calmese.

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,080
Papa is coming home?

197
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,820
No, Mama, it's okay. I'm here.

198
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,060
Who are you?

199
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,820
Ay... rest, Mama.

200
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,430
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Miguel?

202
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,670
Miguel?

203
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,460
Ay.

204
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,370
What are we going to do with that boy?

205
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,250
Ha ha ha, you're right.

206
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,430
That's just what he needs.

207
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Huah!

208
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,250
Oh, it's you. Get in here.

209
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,940
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.

210
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,440
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.

211
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,020
Someone can hear me.

212
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,150
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

213
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,040
Other than you.

214
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,950
Ew, okay!

215
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,130
Perfecto.

216
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,890
I have to sing.

217
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,500
I have to play.

218
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,320
The music, it's... it's not just in me.

219
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,300
It is me.

220
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,290
When life gets me down.

221
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,870
I play my guitar.

222
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,060
The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I...

223
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,070
must follow my heart.

224
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,480
Ugh.

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,020
You know that feeling...

226
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,630
like there's a song in the air

227
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,860
and it's playing just for you?

228
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,820
You must have faith, sister.

229
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,170
Oh, but Padre, he will never listen.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,370
He will listen to music!

231
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,710
Never underestimate the power of music.

232
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,630
But my father,

233
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,430
he will never give his permission.

234
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,620
I am done asking permission.

235
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,720
When you see your moment,

236
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,340
you mustn't let it pass you by.

237
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,430
You must seize it.

238
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,820
Se?or de la Cruz,

239
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,380
what did it take for you to seize your moment?

240
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,870
I had to have faith in my dream.

241
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,920
No one was going to hand it to me.

242
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,360
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

243
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,980
Grab it tight...

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,960
and make it come true.

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,270
No more hiding, Dante.

246
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,940
I gotta seize my moment.

247
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,060
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me.

248
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,730
Dia de Muertos has begun!

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,680
No, no, no, no, no.

250
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,610
We have to make a clear path.

251
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,930
The petals guide our ancestors home.

252
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,020
- Mama! - Hunh!

253
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,530
Where should we put this table?

254
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,760
In the courtyard, mijos.

255
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,050
You want it down by the kitchen?

256
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,750
Si, eh, next to the other one.

257
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,320
Get under, get under!

258
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,160
Miguel?

259
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,140
Uh, nothing.

260
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,450
Mama, Papa, I...

261
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,590
Miguel, your abuelita have

262
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,490
the most wonderful idea.

263
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,910
We've all decided...

264
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,660
it's time you joined us in the workshop!

265
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,470
What?

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,180
No more shining shoes.

267
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,030
You will be making them, every day, after school.

268
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, our Miguelitititito

269
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,730
carrying on the family tradition.

270
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,750
And on Dia de los Muertos!

271
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,860
Your ancestors would be so proud.

272
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,380
You'll craft huaraches just like your Tia Victoria.

273
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,040
And wing tips just like your Papa Julio.

274
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,860
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?

275
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,280
Ay, Miguel.

276
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,720
You have your family here to guide you.

277
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,060
You are a Rivera.

278
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,020
And a Rivera is?

279
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,050
A shoemaker...

280
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,110
through and through.

281
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,480
That's my boy!

282
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,360
Haha! Berto! Break out the good stuff!

283
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,580
Dante!

284
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,710
No, Dante, stop!

285
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,640
Ah!

286
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,330
No, no, no, no, no!

287
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,240
No.

288
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,700
De la Cruz' guitar?

289
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,020
Papa?

290
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,260
Mama Coco.

291
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,160
Is your papa Ernesto de la Cruz?

292
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,810
Papa! Papa!

293
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,270
Papa, Papa!

294
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,520
It's him!

295
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,290
I know who my great-great-grandfather was!

296
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
Miguel, get down from there.

297
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,810
Mama Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

298
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,450
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,310
I'm gonna be a musician!

300
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,540
What is all this?

301
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,820
You keep secrets from your own family?

302
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,770
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

303
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,740
Fills his head with crazy fantasies.

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,970
It's not a fantasy.

305
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,220
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz.

306
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,950
The greatest musician of all time.

307
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,770
We've never known anything about this man.

308
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,360
Or whoever he was, he still abandoned his family.

309
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,780
It's no future for my son.

310
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,800
Well, Papa, y-you said my family would guide me.

311
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,060
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

312
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm supposed to play music.

313
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,270
Never! That man's music was a curse.

314
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,860
I will not allow it.

315
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,730
- If you would just... - Miguel.

316
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,990
You will listen to your family.

317
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,760
No more music.

318
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,020
Just listen to me play.

319
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,440
End of argument.

320
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,050
You want to end up like that man?

321
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,230
Forgotten?

322
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,500
Left off your family's ofrenda?

323
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,690
I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.

324
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,770
- No! - Mama!

325
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,350
There.

326
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,700
No guitar.

327
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,190
No music.

328
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,350
Aw, come.

329
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,630
You'll feel better after you eat with your family.

330
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,340
I don't wanna be in this family!

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,700
Miguel, Miguel!

332
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,120
I-I wanna play in the plaza.

333
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,190
Like de la Cruz.

334
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,660
C-can I still sign up?

335
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,730
You got an instrument?

336
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,420
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.

337
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,400
Musicians gotta bring their own instruments.

338
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,250
You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list.

339
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,200
Hey, excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?

340
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,560
Sorry, muchaco.

341
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,120
You guys have a spare guitar?

342
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,070
No.

343
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,420
I need a guitar just for a little bit.

344
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,000
Get outta here, kid.

345
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,710
Great-great-grandfather.

346
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,050
What am I supposed to do?

347
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,080
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop.

348
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,160
Callate, shh.

349
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
Se?or de la Cruz.

351
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,470
Please don't be mad.

352
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,980
I-I'm Miguel.

353
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,810
Your great-great-grandson.

354
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,400
I-I need to borrow this.

355
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,780
Our family thinks music is a curse.

356
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,440
None of them understand. But I know you would have.

357
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,130
You would have told me to follow my heart.

358
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
To seize my moment.

359
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,940
So, if it's all right with you...

360
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.

361
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,520
Just like you did!

362
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,180
What's going on?

363
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,940
Somebody stole de la Cruz' guitar.

364
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,550
The window is broken, look!

365
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,390
All right, who's in there?

366
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm sorry, i-it's not what it looks like.

367
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,290
De la Cruz is my...

368
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,980
There's nobody here!

369
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,110
- Miguel! - Mama!

370
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,860
Miguel, come home!

371
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,090
Dios mio, little boy! Are you okay?

372
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
Here, let me help you.

373
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,440
Thanks. I...

374
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,310
Do you mind?

375
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,280
Look how big she's getting.

376
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,520
Uh! Dante?

377
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,860
You can see me?

378
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,200
Wait! What's going on?

379
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,760
Dante! Dante!

380
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,860
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

381
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,750
Miguel?

382
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,680
- Miguel? - Miguel?

383
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,450
Y-you're here!

384
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,500
Here here.

385
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,750
And you can see us?

386
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,570
Our Miguelitititito!

387
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,030
Remind me how I know you?

388
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,520
We're your family, mijo.

389
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,550
Tia Rosita?

390
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,840
Si.

391
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,790
Papa Julio?

392
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,020
Hola!

393
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Tia Vic...toria?

394
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,600
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

395
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,180
He's not quite alive, either.

396
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,690
We need Mama Imelda.

397
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,230
She'll know how to fix this.

398
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,440
Oye!

399
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,970
It's Mama Imelda!

400
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,370
She couldn't cross over!

401
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,200
She's stuck!

402
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,710
On the other side!

403
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,200
Tio Oscar?

404
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,660
Tio Felipe?

405
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,940
Oh, hey, Miguel.

406
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,360
I have a feeling this has something to do with you.

407
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,190
But if Mama Imelda can't come to us...

408
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,980
Then we are going to her!

409
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,960
- Whoa! - Vamonos!

410
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,870
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.

411
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,560
Dante?

412
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,940
Dante!

413
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,130
Dante, wait up!

414
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,190
You've gotta stay with me, boy.

415
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,110
You don't know...

416
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,970
where...

417
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,270
This isn't a dream, then.

418
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,150
You're all really out there.

419
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,290
You thought we weren't?

420
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh, I don't know.

421
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,870
I thought it might have been one of those made-up things...

422
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,530
that adults tell kids, like...

423
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,220
vitamins.

424
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,530
Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

425
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,410
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.

426
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,930
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

427
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,750
Ay, Santa Ma...

428
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,930
Are those?

429
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,590
Alebrijes!

430
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,610
- But those are... - Real alebrijes.

431
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,290
Spirit creatures.

432
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,950
They guide souls on their journey.

433
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,610
Watch your step, they make cacitas everywhere.

434
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,580
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

435
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,310
Please have all offerings ready for re-entry.

436
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,620
Welcome back.

437
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,860
Anything to declare?

438
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,460
Some churros, from my family.

439
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,710
How wonderful!

440
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,170
If you're experiencing travel issues...

441
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,400
Agents at the Department of Family Reunion

442
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,250
are available to assist you.

443
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,870
Next family, please.

444
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,380
Oh, your photos are in your son's ofrenda.

445
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,430
Have a great visit.

446
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,610
- Gracias. - Gracias.

447
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
And remember to return before sunrise.

448
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,880
Enjoy your visit!

449
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,850
Next?

450
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,110
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.

451
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,540
Enjoy your visit.

452
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,570
Grashiash.

453
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,620
Next?

454
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,940
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

455
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,420
Shall we skip the scanner?

456
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,910
I'm on so many ofrendas

457
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,580
it will just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

458
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,870
Whoa, shoot.

459
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,040
Looks like no one put up your photo...

460
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,490
Frida?

461
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,060
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now...

462
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,920
That.

463
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,860
That was a lie.

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
And I apologize for doing that.

465
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,920
No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.

466
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,830
You know what?

467
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,740
I'm just gonna zip right over. You won't even know I'm gone.

468
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,530
Almost... there...

469
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,700
Just a little... further...

470
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,470
Upsy daisy.

471
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,690
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?

472
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,820
Dumb flower bridge!

473
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,320
Aw, I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.

474
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,150
Next?

475
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,950
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.

476
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,570
Welcome back, amigo.

477
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,840
Anything to declare?

478
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,680
A-as a matter of fact...

479
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,920
Yes.

480
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,490
Hola.

481
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,900
I miss my nose.

482
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,110
Come on, help us out, amigo.

483
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,900
We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

484
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,720
We are not visiting your ex-wife, Stanley,

485
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,850
por Dia de Muertos.

486
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,400
I demand to speak to the person in charge.

487
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,170
I'm sorry, se?ora, it says here

488
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,480
no one put up your photo.

489
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,830
My family always, always put my photo up in the ofrenda

490
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,900
That devil box tells you nothing but lies.

491
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,620
Mama Imelda?

492
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,470
Oh, mi familia.

493
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,400
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

494
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,850
Tell this woman and her devil box

495
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,310
that my photo is in the ofrenda.

496
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,740
Well, w-we never made it to the ofrenda.

497
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,810
What?

498
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,410
We ran into a...

499
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,540
Hunh! Miguel?

500
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
Mama Imelda.

501
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,960
What is going on?

502
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,430
You the Rivera family?

503
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,620
Well, you're cursed.

504
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,650
What?

505
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,080
Dia de los Muertos is a night to give to the dead.

506
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,620
You stole from the dead.

507
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,450
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.

508
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,440
Guitar?

509
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,680
It was my great-great-grandfather's.

510
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,870
He would have wanted me to have it.

511
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,100
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that musician.

512
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,130
He is dead to this family.

513
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,980
Uh, you're all dead.

514
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,920
Achoo!

515
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,730
I am sorry, uh, who's alebrije is that?

516
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,730
That's Dante.

517
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,980
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

518
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,600
He just looks like a plain old dog.

519
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,960
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.

520
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,370
Whatever he is, I am- achoo!

521
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,720
terribly allergic.

522
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,620
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

523
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,150
And I don't have a nose and yet here we are.

524
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,370
Achoo!

525
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,120
But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.

526
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,850
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

527
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,050
It was an accident.

528
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,350
How do we send him back?

529
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,610
Well, since it's a family matter...

530
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,180
The way to undo a family curse is

531
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
to get your family's blessing.

532
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,940
That's it?

533
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,290
Get your family's blessing

534
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,000
and everything should go back to normal.

535
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,090
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.

536
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,620
What happens at sunrise?

537
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,620
Hijole, your hand!

538
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,330
Huh!

539
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,780
Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you fainting on us.

540
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,560
But not to worry.

541
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,640
Your family is here.

542
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,540
You can get your blessing right now.

543
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,820
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.

544
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,310
Perdon, se?ora.

545
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,090
Now, you look at the living and say his name.

546
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,930
Miguel.

547
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,940
Nailed it.

548
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,450
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

549
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,310
I give you my blessing.

550
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,040
I give you my blessing to go home...

551
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,690
To put my photo back on the ofrenda...

552
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,900
And to never play music again.

553
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,780
What? She can't do that!

554
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,200
Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants.

555
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,110
Fine.

556
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,270
Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

557
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,940
Ha!

558
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,350
No skeletons.

559
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,510
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

560
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,170
Two seconds and you already break your promise.

561
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,080
This isn't fair, it's my life.

562
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,750
You already had yours.

563
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,070
Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing.

564
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,040
Tia Rosita?

565
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,670
Oscar?

566
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,530
Felipe?

567
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,740
Tia Victoria?

568
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,540
Don't make this hard, mijo.

569
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,370
You go home my way, or no way.

570
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,080
You really hate music that much?

571
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,150
I will not let you go down the same path he did.

572
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,970
The same path he did.

573
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,210
He's family.

574
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,730
Listen to your Mama Imelda.

575
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,720
She's just looking out for you.

576
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,260
Be reasonable.

577
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,370
Con permiso, I need to visit the rest room.

578
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,630
Be right back.

579
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,600
Ah, should we tell him

580
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,850
there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

581
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,940
Vamonos.

582
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,240
We got a family looking for a living boy.

583
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,300
I wanna be a musician, I need a musician's blessing.

584
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,260
We gotta find my great-great-grandpa.

585
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,390
Hold it, muchaco.

586
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,330
Huh!

587
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,220
I found that little boy!

588
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,250
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

589
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
Excuse me.

590
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,600
Oh.

591
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,900
Dante.

592
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,550
Disturbing the peace.

593
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,000
Fleeing an officer.

594
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,810
Falsifying a unibrow.

595
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,940
That's illegal?

596
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,340
Very illegal.

597
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,600
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

598
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,630
Amigo?

599
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,510
Oh, that's-that's so nice to hear you say that because

600
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,630
I have just had a really hard Dia de Muertos

601
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,700
and I could really use an amigo right now.

602
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,680
And amigos, they help their amigos.

603
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,270
Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight...

604
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,190
and I'll make it worth your while.

605
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,500
You like de la Cruz?

606
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,770
He and I go way back.

607
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,190
I can get you front row seats to his sunrise spectacular show.

608
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,590
I-I'll get you backstage. You can meet him.

609
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,240
You just gotta let me cross that bridge.

610
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,610
I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday.

611
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,630
But my shift's almost up and...

612
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,590
I wanna visit my living family.

613
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,290
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

614
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,260
Can I at least get my costume back?

615
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,770
Uh... no.

616
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,730
Ser maldito.

617
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,860
Hey.

618
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,260
Hey!

619
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,810
You really know de la Cruz?

620
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,410
Who wants to... ah! Ay! You're alive!

621
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,870
Yeah, I'm alive.

622
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,030
And I want to get back to the Land of the Living...

623
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,320
I need de la Cruz' blessing.

624
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,870
That's weirdly specific.

625
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,590
He's my great-great-grandfather.

626
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,370
He's your gr-gr-gr- what?

627
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,930
Ew.

628
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

629
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,380
Wait, wait.

630
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,740
Hunh!

631
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,650
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait

632
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,310
Wait, uh, wait,

633
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,640
Wait, uh, wait, wait,

634
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:16,950
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,

635
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,330
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

636
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:17,690
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

637
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,000
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

638
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,540
Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living!

639
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,370
You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good...

640
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,320
Ni?o, ni?o, I can help you.

641
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,220
You can help me. We can help each other.

642
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,070
But most importantly, you can help me.

643
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,100
- Miguel! - Huh!

644
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,090
- I'm Hector. - That's nice.

645
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,550
Esperame, chamaco!

646
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,870
Ay! He is going to get himself killed!

647
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,800
I need my spirit guide...

648
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,090
Pepita.

649
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,350
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

650
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,570
Here... n-nice alebrije.

651
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,960
Hey, hey, hold still.

652
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,480
Look up, look up. A ver, a ver.

653
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,040
Look up, up, up!

654
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,100
Okay.

655
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,850
Eh. Ta-da!

656
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,420
Dead as a doorknob.

657
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,630
So listen, Miguel. This place runs on memories.

658
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,010
When you're well remembered, people put up your photo...

659
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,470
and you get to cross the bridge

660
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,740
and visit the living on Dia de Muertos.

661
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
Unless you're me.

662
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,320
You don't get to cross over?

663
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,030
No one's ever put up my picture.

664
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,800
But you can change that!

665
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,500
This is you?

666
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,960
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?

667
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,220
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa...

668
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,800
Then I put up your photo when I get home?

669
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,270
Such a smart boy!

670
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,110
Yes! Great idea, yes!

671
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,880
One hiccup, de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to...

672
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,590
and I need to cross that bridge soon. Like tonight.

673
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,440
So, you got any other family here, you know?

674
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,870
Someone a bit more, eh, accessible?

675
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,250
Um... nope.

676
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,880
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

677
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,460
You gotta have some other family.

678
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,970
Only de la Cruz.

679
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,150
If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.

680
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,640
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid. Fine, fine.

681
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,510
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

682
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,570
It's not gonna be easy, you know.

683
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,290
You know, he's a- he's a busy man.

684
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,000
Wait, what are you doing?

685
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,500
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

686
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,210
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

687
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,300
It's how you walk.

688
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,430
No, I don't.

689
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,250
Stop it!

690
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,590
Whoa!

691
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,530
Ernesto de la Cruz' Sunrise Spectacular?

692
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,590
Que padre?

693
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,940
Wuacch, every year, your great-great-grandpa

694
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,890
puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Dia de Muertos.

695
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,440
A-a-and you can get us in!

696
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,410
I'm...

697
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,320
Hey, you said you had front-row tickets!

698
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,190
That...

699
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,080
that was a lie.

700
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,640
I apologize for that.

701
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Cool off, chamaco, come on. I'll get you to him.

702
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,750
How?

703
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,180
'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing.

704
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,610
Ugh.

705
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,250
You better have my dress, Hector.

706
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,730
Hola, Ceci!

707
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,110
Ay!

708
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,600
Hola.

709
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,730
Cezi!

710
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,880
I lost the dress.

711
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,430
Ay, diosa Mia!

712
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,680
I've got to dress 40 dancers by sunrise.

713
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,080
- And thanks to you... - Cezi, Cezi...

714
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,240
- I'm one Frida short - Cezi...

715
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,560
of an opening number. - Dante.

716
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,210
Dante!

717
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,900
We shouldn't be in here.

718
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,070
Dante! Ven aca!

719
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,130
You! How did you get in here?

720
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,250
I-I just followed my...

721
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,250
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!

722
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,800
Guider of wandering spirits.

723
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,130
And whose spirit have you guided to me?

724
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,690
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

725
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,350
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this world can take many forms.

726
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,340
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.

727
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,190
Or maybe he's just a dog.

728
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,370
Come! I need your eyes.

729
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,000
Your are the audience.

730
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,380
Darkness!

731
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,580
And from the darkness...

732
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,880
A giant papaya!

733
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,350
Dancers emerge from the papaya.

734
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,100
And the dancers...

735
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Are all me!

736
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,650
And they go to drink from the milk of their mother.

737
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,600
Who is a cactus. But who is also me!

738
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,980
And her milk is not milk...

739
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,760
but tears.

740
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,290
Is it too obvious?

741
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,550
I think it's just the right amount of obvious.

742
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,540
It could use some music.

743
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,050
Oh, what if you did like...

744
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,630
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?

745
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,940
Oh, and then it could go...

746
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,890
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala Whenk?

747
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,670
And what if everything was on fire?

748
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,390
Yes! Fire everywhere!

749
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,900
Inspired.

750
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,760
You. You have the spirit of an artist.

751
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,690
The dancers exit. The music fades. The lights go out.

752
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,940
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage.

753
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,700
Huh?

754
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,670
He does a couple of songs. The sun rises. Everyone cheers.

755
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,760
Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?

756
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,620
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.

757
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,810
He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.

758
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,520
Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that.

759
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,340
Come on, stop pestering the celebrities.

760
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,540
You said my great-great-grandpa would be here.

761
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,180
He's halfway across town throwing some big party.

762
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,030
That bum. Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?

763
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,770
If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?

764
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,030
He's your great-great-grandpa. How come he didn't invite you?

765
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,250
Hey, Gustavo! You know anything about this party?

766
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,210
Sh-it's the hot ticket!

767
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,970
But if you're not on the guest list, you're never gettin' in,

768
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,250
Chorizo.

769
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,010
Hey, it's Chorizo!

770
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,820
Ah-ha, very funny, guys. Very funny.

771
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,070
Chorizo?

772
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,990
Oh, this guy's famous.

773
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,150
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

774
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,820
I-I don't wanna talk about it.

775
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,540
He choked on some chorizo!

776
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,430
I didn't choke, okay? I got food poisoning

777
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,860
which is a big difference.

778
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,510
This is why I don't like musicians.

779
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,420
Bunch of self-important jerks!

780
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,990
Hey, I'm a musician.

781
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,290
- You are? - Well...

782
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,240
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...

783
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,360
there is that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz.

784
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,190
Winner gets to play at his party.

785
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,710
No, no, no, Chamaco! You are loco if you think...

786
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,510
I need to get my great-great- grandfather's blessing.

787
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,760
You know where I can get a guitar?

788
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,020
Ay... I know a guy.

789
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,640
Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy?

790
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,320
A footprint!

791
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,850
It's a Rivera boot.

792
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,630
- Size seven! - And a half.

793
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,940
- Pronated. - Miguel.

794
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,240
Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?

795
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,370
My great-great-grandfather's a musician.

796
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,640
Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers?

797
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,820
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.

798
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,670
What do you know?

799
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,230
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?

800
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,620
We're almost there.

801
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,940
Keep up, chamaco, come on!

802
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,420
Cousin Hector!

803
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,070
Hey! These guys!

804
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,070
Hector!

805
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,500
Hey, tio, que onda?

806
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,170
These people are all you family?

807
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,030
Eh... yeah, in a way.

808
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,910
We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.

809
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,590
No family to go home to.

810
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,960
Nearly forgotten, you know?

811
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:47,340
So we all call each other "cousin" or "tio" or-or whatever.

812
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,700
- Hector! - Tia Chelos! Hey!

813
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,060
Muchas gracias.

814
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,400
Save some for me.

815
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,860
Is Chicharron around?

816
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,400
In the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors.

817
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,850
Ah, who doesn't like a visit from cousin Hector?

818
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,720
Huh!

819
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,520
Buenas noches, Chicharron.

820
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,990
I don't want to see your stupid face, Hector.

821
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,370
Come on, its Dia de Muertos.

822
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,700
I brought you a little offering.

823
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,100
Get outta here!

824
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,990
I would Chich, but the thing is...

825
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,180
me and my friend Miguel...

826
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,190
we really need to borrow your guitar.

827
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,750
- My guitar? - Yes.

828
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,260
My prized, beloved guitar?

829
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,940
I promise we'll bring it right back.

830
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,250
Like the time you promised to bring back my van?

831
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,250
Eh...

832
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,700
- Or my mini fridge? - Oh, you see...

833
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,990
Or my good napkins, my lasso, my femur?!

834
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,140
No, not like those things.

835
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,490
Where's my femur, you...

836
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,690
Oh, oh.

837
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,290
You okay, amigo?

838
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm fading, Hector.

839
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,300
I can feel it.

840
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,290
I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to.

841
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,600
You, play me something.

842
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,260
Oh, you know I don't play anymore, Chich.

843
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
The guitar's for the kid.

844
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,460
You want it?

845
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,890
You've got to earn it.

846
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,090
Ay, only for you, amigo.

847
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,990
Any requests?

848
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,980
You know my favorite, Hector.

849
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,050
Those aren't the words.

850
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,710
There are children present.

851
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,650
Brings back memories.

852
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,660
Gracias.

853
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,060
Wait, what happened?

854
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,170
He's been forgotten.

855
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,220
When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you...

856
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,570
you disappear from this world.

857
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,990
We call it "The Final Death."

858
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,360
W-where did he go?

859
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,750
No one knows.

860
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,120
But I've met him.

861
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,310
I could remember him... when I go back.

862
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,770
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.

863
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,660
Our memories...

864
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,220
They have to be passed down by those who knew us in life.

865
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,030
In the stories they tell about us.

866
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,540
But there's no one left alive to pass down Chich's stories.

867
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,610
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

868
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,100
Come on, de la Cruzito, you've got a contest to win.

869
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,970
You told me you hated musicians.

870
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,550
You never said you were one.

871
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,740
How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa?

872
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,220
We used to play music together.

873
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,770
Taught him everything he knows.

874
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,170
No manches.

875
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,330
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz?

876
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,050
The greatest musician of all time?

877
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,100
Oh! Oh, you're funny.

878
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Greatest eyebrows of all time, maybe.

879
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,110
But his music, eh, not so much.

880
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,280
You don't know what you're talking about.

881
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,590
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.

882
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,770
Showtime, chamaco.

883
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,290
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.

884
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,240
Bienvenidos a todos!

885
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,380
Who's ready for some musica?

886
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,800
It's a Battle of the Bands, amigos.

887
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,840
The winner gets to play for the maestro himself...

888
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,270
Ernesto de la Cruz on his fiesta tonight!

889
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,410
That's our ticket, muchacho.

890
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,430
Let the competition begin!

891
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,560
So, what's the plan? W-what are you gonna play?

892
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,480
Definitely "Remember Me."

893
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,950
No, not that one. No.

894
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,490
Come on, it's the most popular song.

895
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,620
Ah, it's too popular.

896
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,370
Um, what about... Poco Loco?

897
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Epa! Now, that's a song.

898
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,170
De la Cruzito! You're on standby.

899
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,440
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

900
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,790
Los Chachalacos!

901
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,450
You always this nervous before a performance?

902
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,740
I don't know. I've never performed before.

903
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,640
What? You said you were a musician!

904
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,870
I am! I mean, I-I will be.

905
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,150
- Ay! - Once I win.

906
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,420
That's your plan?

907
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,250
No, no, no, no. You have to win, Miguel.

908
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,990
Your life literally depends on you winning.

909
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,470
And you've never done this before?

910
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,930
- I'll go up. - Uh, n-no!

911
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,560
- I need to do this. - Why?

912
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,850
If I can't go out there and play one song...

913
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,650
how can I call myself a musician?

914
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,720
What does that matter?

915
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,550
'Cause I don't just want to get de la Cruz' blessing.

916
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,490
I need to prove that...

917
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,680
that I'm worthy of it.

918
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,390
Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment.

919
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,880
At such a bad time!

920
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,440
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.

921
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,520
Okay, you wanna perform? Then you've got to perform!

922
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,920
First, you have to loosen up.

923
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,310
Shake off those nerves.

924
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,930
Now, give me your best grito.

925
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,280
My best grito?

926
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,830
Come on, yell. Belt it out.

927
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,960
Oh, it feels good.

928
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,800
Okay, now, now, now you.

929
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,680
Oh, come on, kid.

930
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,980
De la Cruzito! You're on now!

931
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,340
Miguel, look at me. Hey, hey, look at me.

932
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,250
Come on, let's go!

933
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,140
You can do this.

934
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,150
Grab their attention and don't let it go!

935
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,840
Hector...

936
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,420
Make them listen, chamaco. You've got this.

937
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,760
De la Cruzito!

938
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,570
Arriba-Ba! Hey!

939
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,880
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

940
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,460
Bring back the singing dog!

941
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,000
Not bad for a dead guy.

942
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,780
Not so bad yourself, gordito.

943
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,350
Eso!

944
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,730
He's close. Find him.

945
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,560
Numero uno, Miguelito!

946
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,730
We're looking for a living kid.

947
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,170
About twelve?

948
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,120
Have you seen a living boy?

949
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,390
Hey! You did good!

950
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,270
I'm proud of you.

951
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,950
Eso!

952
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,250
Hey, where are you going?

953
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,360
We gotta get outta here.

954
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,410
What? You're crazy! We're about to win this thing.

955
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,830
Damas y caballeros...

956
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,010
I have a emergency announcement.

957
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,260
Please be on the look out for a living boy.

958
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,410
Answers to the name of Miguel.

959
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,400
Earlier tonight, he ran away from his family.

960
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,840
They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living.

961
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,210
Wait, wait, wait.

962
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,010
You said de la Cruz was your only family.

963
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,660
The only person who could send you home.

964
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,910
I do have other family, but...

965
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,970
You could have taken my photo back this whole time?

966
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,980
But they hate music. I need a musician's blessing.

967
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,750
- You lied to me! - Oh, you're one to talk.

968
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,750
Look at me, I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

969
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,540
I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night.

970
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,110
I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge

971
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,170
'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy.

972
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,260
- It's not stupid. - I'm taking you to your family.

973
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,310
- Let go of me. - You'll thank me later.

974
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,670
You don't wanna help me. You only care about yourself.

975
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,170
Keep your dumb photo. - No!

976
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,790
No, no, no! - Stay away from me!

977
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,490
No!

978
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,680
Hey, chamaco?

979
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,250
Where did you go?

980
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,010
Chamaco?

981
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,740
Sorry!

982
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,930
Come back.

983
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,160
Dante, callate.

984
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,950
Don't Dante, stop it.

985
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,610
He can't help me.

986
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,640
Dante, stop.

987
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,210
Stop it.

988
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,470
Leave me alone!

989
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,140
You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog.

990
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,760
Now get outta here!

991
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,150
It's him!

992
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,500
It's that living boy!

993
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,710
I've heard about him, look!

994
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,850
He's alive.

995
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,600
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

996
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,190
I am giving you my blessing, and you are going home.

997
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,010
I don't want your blessing.

998
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,290
Miguel! Stop!

999
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,210
Come back!

1000
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,350
Miguel!

1001
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,750
I am trying to save your life.

1002
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,230
You're ruining my life.

1003
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,200
What?

1004
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,110
Music's the only thing that makes me happy.

1005
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,020
A-and you... you wanna take that away.

1006
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,640
You'll never understand.

1007
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,190
I-I thought you hated music.

1008
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,090
Oh, I loved it.

1009
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,550
I remember that feeling.

1010
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,160
When my husband would play, and I would sing.

1011
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,880
And nothing else mattered.

1012
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,930
But when we had Coco...

1013
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,120
suddenly, there was something in my life that mattered more than music.

1014
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,880
I wanted to put down rules.

1015
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,710
He wanted to play for the world.

1016
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,550
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.

1017
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,920
Now, you must make a choice.

1018
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,910
But I don't wanna pick sides.

1019
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,010
Why can't you be on my side?

1020
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,270
That's what family's supposed to do.

1021
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,370
Support you.

1022
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,830
But you never will.

1023
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,970
Have a good time.

1024
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,340
Oh, how exciting!

1025
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,570
Oh, El Santo!

1026
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,730
I-I-I'm a big fan.

1027
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,630
You mind if I?

1028
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,050
Gracias, se?or.

1029
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,730
Invitation?

1030
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,040
It's okay, I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

1031
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,470
Disculpe, se?ores.

1032
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,410
Hey, hey, guys, it's Poco Loco!

1033
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,120
You were on fire tonight.

1034
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,380
You too!

1035
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,820
Hey, musician to musician, I need a favor.

1036
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,110
Oh, the competition winners. Congratulations, chicos.

1037
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,100
Thanks guys.

1038
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,260
- Hey, enjoy the party, little musico. - Gracias.

1039
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,610
Look, it's Ernesto.

1040
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,650
De la Cruz.

1041
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,750
Se?or de la Cruz!

1042
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,580
Pardon me.

1043
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,730
Se?or de la Cruz!

1044
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,230
Se?or de la...

1045
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,280
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.

1046
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,220
You must seize it.

1047
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,220
We're almost there, Dante.

1048
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,680
Se?or de la Cruz!

1049
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,340
Se?or de la...

1050
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,100
But what can we do? It is hopeless.

1051
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,890
You must have faith, sister.

1052
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,300
Oh, but Padre, he will never listen.

1053
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,530
He will listen to music.

1054
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,580
Ah!

1055
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,890
Are you all right, ni?o?

1056
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,250
It-it's you.

1057
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,820
Y-you are that boy.

1058
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,830
The one who came from the Land of the Living.

1059
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,200
You... know about me?

1060
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,700
You're all anyone has been talking about.

1061
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:03,100
Why have you come here?

1062
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,670
I'm Miguel.

1063
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:08,330
Your g-great-great-grandson.

1064
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,320
I have a great-great-grandson?

1065
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,530
I need your blessing.

1066
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,430
So I can go back home and be a musician just like you.

1067
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,870
The rest of our family...

1068
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,960
they wouldn't listen.

1069
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,000
But I... I hoped you would.

1070
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,680
My boy, with a talent like yours...

1071
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,890
how could I not listen?

1072
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,040
Haha! I have a great-great-grandson!

1073
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,990
Look, it's Frida!

1074
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,120
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

1075
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,810
It is an honor, se?ora.

1076
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,310
Gracias.

1077
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,800
Hey, Negrete, Infante.

1078
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,060
Have you met my great-great-grandson?

1079
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,310
My great-great-grandson!

1080
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,720
He is alive and a musician, to boot.

1081
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,850
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

1082
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,050
No dimple!

1083
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,640
To our friendship. Haha!

1084
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,790
I'd move heaven and earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1085
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,010
Poison!

1086
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,600
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1087
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,480
All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living.

1088
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,400
They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with.

1089
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,850
Hey, what's wrong?

1090
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,850
Is it too much? You look overwhelmed.

1091
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,220
N-no, It's all great.

1092
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,560
- But? - It's just...

1093
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,800
I've been looking up to you my whole life.

1094
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,490
You're the guy who actually did it.

1095
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,470
But did you ever regret it?

1096
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,180
Choosing music over everything else?

1097
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:57,090
It was hard saying goodbye to my hometown.

1098
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,980
Heading off on my own.

1099
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,280
Leaving your family?

1100
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,870
Si.

1101
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,050
But I could not have done it differently.

1102
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,260
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

1103
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,950
And you, my great-great-grandson...

1104
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,400
are meant to be a musician.

1105
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,120
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1106
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,320
We cannot belong to one family.

1107
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,810
The world is our family!

1108
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:27,660
Ooh-hoo! Ooh! The fireworks have begun!

1109
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,220
Soon, the party will move across town for my sunrise spectacular.

1110
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,450
Hunh! Miguel, you must come to the show!

1111
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,640
You will be my guest of honor.

1112
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,310
- You mean it? - Of course, my boy.

1113
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,970
I can't.

1114
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:56,480
I have to get home before sunrise.

1115
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,090
Oy! I really do need to get you home.

1116
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,360
It has been an honor.

1117
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,960
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1118
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,130
I hope you die very soon.

1119
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,210
You know what I mean.

1120
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,560
Miguel...

1121
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,420
I give you my blessing.

1122
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,390
We had a deal, chamaco.

1123
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,960
Who are you? What is the meaning of this?

1124
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,740
Oh, Frida. I thought you couldn't make it.

1125
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,670
You said you'd take back my photo.

1126
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,340
You promised, Miguel.

1127
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,050
You know this uh, man?

1128
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,790
I just met him tonight.

1129
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,820
He told me he knew you.

1130
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,220
H...Hector?

1131
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,630
Please, Miguel.

1132
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,300
Put my photo up.

1133
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,520
My friend. You're... you're being forgotten.

1134
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,610
And whose fault is that?

1135
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,650
- Hector, please. - Those were my songs you took.

1136
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,300
My songs that made you famous.

1137
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,250
- What? - If I'm being forgotten...

1138
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,280
It's because you never told anyone that I wrote them.

1139
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,620
That's crazy. De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

1140
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,290
You wanna tell him? Or should I?

1141
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,910
Hector, I never meant to take credit.

1142
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,330
We made a great team, but...

1143
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:11,410
you died, and... I-I only sang your songs because

1144
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,710
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

1145
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,450
Oh, how generous!

1146
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,470
You really did play together.

1147
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,110
Look, I don't want to fight about it.

1148
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,020
I just want you to make it right.

1149
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,040
Miguel can put my photo up.

1150
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,290
- Hector. - And I can cross over the bridge.

1151
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,050
I could see my girl.

1152
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,670
Ernesto.

1153
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,540
Remember the night I left?

1154
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,960
That was a long time ago.

1155
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,260
We drank together.

1156
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:37,380
And you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo.

1157
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,260
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1158
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,050
Heaven and earth?

1159
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,270
Like in the movie?

1160
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,070
What?

1161
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,760
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1162
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,030
In the de la Cruz movie, "El Camino a Casa."

1163
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,690
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1164
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,660
No, it's in there.

1165
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,810
Look!

1166
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,440
This calls for a toast.

1167
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,100
To our friendship! Haha!

1168
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,690
I would move heaven and earth for you, mi amigo.

1169
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,600
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1170
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,390
Salud.

1171
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,140
Poison!

1172
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,910
That night, Ernesto.

1173
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,030
The night I left.

1174
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,640
We've been performing on the road for months.

1175
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,870
I got homesick and I packed up my songs.

1176
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,960
You wanna give up now?

1177
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,130
When we're this close to reaching our dream?

1178
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,150
This was your dream. You'll manage.

1179
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,320
I can't do this without your songs, Hector.

1180
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,900
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1181
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,310
Hate me if you want. But my mind is made up.

1182
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,610
Oh, I could never hate you.

1183
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,060
If you must go, then I'm... I'm sending you off with a toast.

1184
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,500
To our friendship.

1185
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,630
I would move heaven and earth for you, mi amigo.

1186
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,160
Salud!

1187
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,500
You walked me to the train station.

1188
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,050
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

1189
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,240
I thought it must have been something I ate.

1190
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,320
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

1191
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,100
Or something I drank.

1192
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,430
I woke up dead.

1193
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,160
You...

1194
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,770
poisoned me!

1195
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,700
You're confusing movies with reality, Hector.

1196
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,730
All this time, I thought it was just bad luck.

1197
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,420
I never thought that you might have...

1198
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,170
that you...

1199
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,680
How could you?

1200
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,460
Hector!

1201
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,620
Security! Security!

1202
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,630
You took everything away from me!

1203
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,800
You rat!

1204
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,110
Have him taken care of.

1205
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,020
He's not well.

1206
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,620
I just wanted to move back home!

1207
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,230
No! No!

1208
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,200
I apologize.

1209
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,390
Where were we?

1210
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,610
You were going to give me your blessing.

1211
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,020
Yes... ah... Si.

1212
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,320
Miguel...

1213
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,700
My reputation... it is...

1214
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:07,310
very important to me.

1215
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,600
I would hate to have you think...

1216
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,700
That you m-murdered Hector for his songs?

1217
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,780
You don't think that.

1218
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,180
Do you?

1219
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:23,060
I... No... Everyone knows you're the... the good guy.

1220
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,960
Papa Ernesto... my blessing?

1221
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,850
Security?

1222
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:39,070
Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay.

1223
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,490
What?

1224
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,080
But I'm your family!

1225
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,190
And Hector was my best friend.

1226
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:47,740
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

1227
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:51,390
You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to...

1228
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,880
seize your moment.

1229
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,080
I know you understand.

1230
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,100
No! No!

1231
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,540
Let go!

1232
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,110
No!

1233
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,800
Aah!

1234
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,700
Help!

1235
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,940
Can anyone hear me?

1236
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,730
I wanna go home!

1237
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,060
Huh?

1238
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,810
H-Hector?

1239
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,920
- Kid? - Oh, Hector!

1240
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,920
You were right.

1241
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,820
I should have gone back to my family.

1242
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,940
- Hey, hey, hey. - They told me not to be like de la Cruz.

1243
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,070
- But I didn't listen. - Hey, it's okay.

1244
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,440
But I told them I didn't care if they remembered me.

1245
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:08,520
I didn't care if was on the stupid ofrenda.

1246
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,840
Hey, chamaco, it's okay.

1247
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,090
It's okay.

1248
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,520
I told them I didn't care.

1249
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,240
- Huh! Oh! - Hector!

1250
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,080
Hector?

1251
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,570
She's...

1252
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,530
forgetting me.

1253
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,870
Who?

1254
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,890
My daughter.

1255
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,960
She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge.

1256
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,740
I just wanted to see her again.

1257
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,330
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1258
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,560
I wish I could apologize.

1259
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:48,210
I wish I could tell her that her Papa was trying to come home.

1260
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,180
That he loved her so much.

1261
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,040
My Coco.

1262
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,990
Coco?

1263
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,440
Where?

1264
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,860
Where did you get this?

1265
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,390
That's my Mama Coco.

1266
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,470
That's my Mama Imelda.

1267
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,470
Is that...

1268
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,590
You?

1269
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,180
We're...

1270
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:33,580
- family? - Family?

1271
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,850
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1272
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,690
That she'd miss me.

1273
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:52,600
Maybe put up my photo.

1274
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,950
But it never happened.

1275
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,580
You know the worst part?

1276
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:00,850
Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world...

1277
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,680
I thought at least one day, I'd see her here.

1278
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,330
Give her the biggest hug.

1279
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,510
But she's the last person who remembers me.

1280
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,560
The moment she's gone from the living world...

1281
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,560
You disappear.

1282
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,340
From this one.

1283
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:19,670
You'll never get to see her.

1284
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,360
Ever again.

1285
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,700
You know...

1286
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,630
I wrote her a song once.

1287
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,030
We used to sing it every night.

1288
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,540
At the same time.

1289
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:34,370
No matter how far apart we were.

1290
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,080
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her.

1291
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,090
One...

1292
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,110
last...

1293
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,460
time.

1294
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,460
Papa!

1295
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,930
H-He stole your guitar.

1296
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,880
He stole your songs.

1297
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,530
You should be the one the world remembers.

1298
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,780
Not de la Cruz.

1299
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,230
I didn't write "Remember Me" for the world.

1300
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,400
I wrote it for Coco.

1301
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,740
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa.

1302
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:08,210
Are you kidding? A minute ago, I thought I was related to a murderer.

1303
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,320
You're a total upgrade.

1304
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,410
My whole life...

1305
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,840
there's been something that made me different.

1306
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,260
And I never knew where it came from.

1307
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,170
But now, I know.

1308
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,930
It comes from you!

1309
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,360
I'm proud we're family.

1310
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,690
I'm proud to be his family!

1311
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,510
I'm proud to be his family!

1312
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:52,740
Dante?

1313
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,850
Dante!

1314
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,200
It's Dante!

1315
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,480
Haha!

1316
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,770
Imelda!

1317
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,770
Hector.

1318
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,570
You look good.

1319
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,930
Dante!

1320
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,560
You knew he was my Papa Hector the whole time!

1321
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,150
You are a real spirit guide.

1322
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:36,150
Who's a good spirit guide? You are!

1323
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:56,830
Dante!

1324
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,160
There they are!

1325
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:24,090
Miguelito! Miguelito!

1326
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,410
Gracias, Dios mio!

1327
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,960
Mijo, I was so worried.

1328
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,320
Thank goodness we found you in time.

1329
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,600
And you.

1330
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,050
How many times must I turn you away?

1331
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,080
Imelda...

1332
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,590
I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death.

1333
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:02,330
I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes.

1334
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,710
He spends five minutes with you, and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1335
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,460
I wasn't in there 'cause of Hector.

1336
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,460
He was in there 'cause of me.

1337
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,140
He was just trying to get me home.

1338
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,980
I didn't wanna listen.

1339
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,920
But he was right.

1340
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,650
Nothing is more important than family.

1341
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:22,630
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1342
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,760
And your conditions.

1343
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:27,440
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1344
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,800
To get Hector's photo.

1345
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:30,800
- What? - So he can see Coco again.

1346
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,670
Hector should be on our ofrenda.

1347
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,230
He's part of our family.

1348
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,760
He left this family.

1349
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,440
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1350
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,490
But de la Cruz murdered him.

1351
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,140
It's true, Imelda.

1352
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,350
And so what if it's true?

1353
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,700
You leave me alone with a child to raise,

1354
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,660
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

1355
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,040
Imelda, I...

1356
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,060
Hector?

1357
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:53,210
Hunh!

1358
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,740
I'm running out of time.

1359
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,900
It's Coco.

1360
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:01,220
She's forgetting you.

1361
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,500
You don't have to forgive him.

1362
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,610
But we shouldn't forget him.

1363
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,580
I wanted to forget you.

1364
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,180
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1365
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,610
This is my fault.

1366
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,630
Not yours.

1367
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,950
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1368
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,710
Miguel...

1369
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,170
If we help you get his photo...

1370
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,780
you will return home.

1371
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,360
No more music.

1372
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,900
Family comes first.

1373
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:43,140
I... I can't forgive you.

1374
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:47,200
But I will help you.

1375
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,980
So how do we get to de la Cruz?

1376
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,030
I might know a way.

1377
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,570
Good luck, muchacho.

1378
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,910
Gracias, Frida.

1379
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:53,690
Ah!

1380
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,220
Here, let me help you with...

1381
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,410
Don't touch me.

1382
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:00,540
Everyone clear on the plan?

1383
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,910
Find Hector's photo.

1384
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,850
Give it to Miguel.

1385
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,880
Send Miguel home.

1386
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,070
Got your petals?

1387
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,280
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1388
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,610
- Yes? - Ah!

1389
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,470
Don't I know you?

1390
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,670
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1391
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,080
- Who the? - She's talking about me.

1392
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:19,580
I'm the love your your life?

1393
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,250
I don't know, I'm still angry at you.

1394
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,840
Hector? How did you...

1395
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,050
And that's for trying to murder my grandson!

1396
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,410
- Grandson? - She's talking about me.

1397
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,730
You!

1398
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:31,780
Wait. You're related to Hector?

1399
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,230
The photo!

1400
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,250
Eh...

1401
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,340
After him!

1402
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,130
Security, ayuda.

1403
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,380
You said love of your life?

1404
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,780
I don't know what I said.

1405
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,510
That's what I heard.

1406
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,460
Places, se?or. You're on in 30 seconds.

1407
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,070
Miguel, I have it!

1408
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,680
Oh!

1409
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,020
Hurry, come on!

1410
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,090
Ladies and gentleman!

1411
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:39,120
The one. The only. Ernesto de la Cruz!

1412
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,610
Get her off the stage!

1413
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,260
Sing!

1414
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,790
Sing!

1415
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,300
I forgot what that felt like.

1416
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:55,110
You... still got it.

1417
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,630
Uh-h-hum...

1418
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,180
Oh!

1419
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:04,040
Miguel, I give you my blessing...

1420
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,840
To go home...

1421
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:09,550
To put up our photos...

1422
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:11,380
And to never...

1423
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,600
Never play music again.

1424
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:19,350
To never forget how much your family loves you.

1425
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:23,410
You're going home.

1426
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,780
You're not going anywhere!

1427
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,600
Imelda!

1428
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:33,330
Stay back! Stay back!

1429
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:35,470
All of you, stay back!

1430
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,270
Not one more step.

1431
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,250
Dante!

1432
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,600
Ernesto, stop!

1433
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,200
Leave the boy alone.

1434
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,120
I've worked too hard, Hector.

1435
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,340
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1436
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,270
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1437
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,980
He's a threat.

1438
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:58,260
You think I'd let him go back to the Land of the Living with your photo?

1439
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,120
To keep your memory alive?

1440
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,760
- No. - You're a coward!

1441
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:05,430
I am Ernesto de la Cruz. The greatest musician of all time.

1442
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:07,440
Hector's the real musician.

1443
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:10,300
You're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs.

1444
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,550
Murdered?

1445
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:14,050
I am the one who's willing to do what it takes

1446
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,080
to seize my moment.

1447
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,110
Whatever it takes.

1448
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:20,060
Aah! Aah!

1449
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,480
No!

1450
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,800
- Miguel! - Miguel!

1451
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,720
Apologies, old friend. But the show must go on.

1452
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,940
Haha!

1453
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,140
Boo! Boo!

1454
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,520
Boo!

1455
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:13,850
Hahaha! Please, please, mi familia!

1456
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,240
- Murderer! - Get off the stage!

1457
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:18,260
Orchestra, a-one, a-two, a-one...

1458
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,550
Hey, creep!

1459
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,820
Look!

1460
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,190
Nice kitty.

1461
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,210
Ah!

1462
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,810
Put me down!

1463
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,870
Please!

1464
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,570
I'm begging you! Stop, stop!

1465
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,460
Aaah!

1466
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,310
Aah! Aaah!

1467
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,820
Oooh!

1468
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,640
Oh! No!

1469
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,760
Aaah!

1470
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,860
Hunh!

1471
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,550
What did I miss?

1472
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,260
Good boy, Dante.

1473
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:24,710
Miguel!

1474
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:26,190
Oh!

1475
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,690
Hector!

1476
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,050
The photo, I lost it.

1477
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,810
It's okay, mijo.

1478
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,190
It's...

1479
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,870
Hector!

1480
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,610
Hector?

1481
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:38,490
Coco.

1482
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,470
No, we can still find the photo.

1483
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,710
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1484
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,300
No, no, no. I can't leave you.

1485
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,440
I promised I put your photo up.

1486
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,740
I promised you'd see Coco.

1487
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:52,290
We're both out of time, mijo.

1488
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:55,120
No! No!

1489
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,020
She can't forget you.

1490
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,180
I just wanted her to know...

1491
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,290
that I loved her.

1492
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,930
Hector!

1493
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:05,390
You have our blessing, Miguel.

1494
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,010
No conditions.

1495
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:11,000
No, Papa Hector. Please!

1496
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,130
No.

1497
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,650
Go home.

1498
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,760
I promise! I-I won't let Coco forget you!

1499
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,460
There he is!

1500
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,270
Miguel! Stop!

1501
01:28:58,390 --> 01:28:59,590
Where have you been?

1502
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,730
Ah! I need to see Mama Coco, please!

1503
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,510
Huh! What are you doing with that?

1504
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,630
Give it to me!

1505
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,240
Miguel, stop.

1506
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:08,760
Miguel! Miguel?

1507
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,270
Miguel!

1508
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:11,970
Mama Coco?

1509
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:13,260
Can you hear me?

1510
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,680
It's Miguel.

1511
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,700
I-I saw your Papa!

1512
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,240
Remember? Papa?

1513
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:21,140
Please.

1514
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,940
If you forget him.

1515
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,450
He'll be gone.

1516
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:25,970
Forever.

1517
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,360
Here. This was his guitar, right?

1518
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,460
He used to play it to you?

1519
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,550
See, there he is.

1520
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,200
Papa, remember? Papa?

1521
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,170
Miguel!

1522
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,360
Mama Coco, please. Don't forget him.

1523
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,810
What are you doing to that poor woman?

1524
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:57,920
It's okay, mother.

1525
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,240
What's gotten into you?

1526
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,620
I thought I lost you, Miguel.

1527
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,320
I'm sorry, Papa.

1528
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,940
We're all together now.

1529
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,040
That's what matters.

1530
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,660
Not all of us.

1531
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,580
It's okay, Mamita.

1532
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:20,570
Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco.

1533
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,840
Mama Coco...

1534
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:31,970
Well, apologize.

1535
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,350
Mama Coco...

1536
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,410
Your Papa...

1537
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,880
He wanted you to have this.

1538
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:45,180
Mama... wait...

1539
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,330
Elena?

1540
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,740
What's wrong, mija?

1541
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,860
Nothing, Mama.

1542
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:04,300
Nothing at all.

1543
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,170
My Papa used to sing me that song.

1544
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,740
He loved you, Mama Coco.

1545
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,110
Your Papa loved you so much.

1546
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:37,940
I kept his letters.

1547
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,950
Poems he wrote me.

1548
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,470
And...

1549
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:04,950
Papa was a musician.

1550
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,480
When I was a little girl...

1551
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:13,190
He and Mama would sing such beautiful songs.

1552
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,070
One year later

1553
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,190
Remember me

1554
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,470
Forgotten.

1555
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,080
And right over here,

1556
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:29,780
one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

1557
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,560
The home of the esteemed songwriter, Hector Rivera.

1558
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:36,980
The letters Hector wrote home for his daughter, Coco

1559
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,900
contain the lyrics for all of your favorite songs.

1560
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,910
Not just "Remember Me."

1561
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,570
And that man is your Papa Julio.

1562
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,590
And there's Tia Rosita.

1563
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,460
And your Tia Victoria.

1564
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:54,230
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1565
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:56,930
There aren't just old pictures, they're our family.

1566
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,670
And they're counting on us to remember them.

1567
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:28,490
Enjoy your visit, Hector.

1568
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,720
Papa!

1569
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,230
Coco!
